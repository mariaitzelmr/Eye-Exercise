Eyes Exercise!!!

#Description

Two eyes will follow your cursor along the screen as you move. No delay! this eyes will follow you real time everywhere you go!! (At least inside the screen, if you get out they might loose track of the cursor).

#How to run

Download the full project, if you keep the files in the same folder, just drop the index.html in your browser to start the game.
If you change the location of the files or if you want to change their names, remember to set the right path and file name in the <script></script> and <link> tags in index.html for the .js file and .css file respectively.

#Future improvements!

-We can add more eyes!!!

-Let's not limit this to eyes following the cursor, lets make balls follow it along the screen, like bees to the honey!! And if a ball reaches the cursor we can change the color or show and explotion animation.

-We can build a sort of spaceship shooting game and shoot with the click to save the cursor from the hungry balls.
